I tried to create a handy webapp to keep track of all the movies I've watched this year and which was my favorite, but form bindings are confusing and it's not working properly :(

Can you help me fix it?

level 1: Update the movie list with a v-for loop so all movies in the provided file movies.json are rendered. Feel free to update/change the list to your likes, or to add more info for each movie.

level 2: Create a small "movie card" for each movie object in the list and display in it the title, a small poster picture, and the score of the movie.

level 3: Remove the duplicated & hardcoded code in the form binding for "My fav movie" selector, and use a v-for loop and attribute bindings to correctly build the options. (Note: you can change the binding variable 'favoriteMovie' below if needed)

level 4: I want it to be easy to see which one is my current favorite, so please add a "üòç" emoji next to the title to my favorite movie in the list.

level 5: The score of each film is represented by a string with a value between "0" and "100". We can do better! Let's show between 1 to 5 stars in each film card, according to the score (tip: use a v-for loop here).

level 6: Fix the multiselectors of the movies I've watched this year. Remove the duplicated & hardcoded code in the form binding for both multi selectors, and use v-for loops and attribute bindings to correctly build the options. Keep in mind they should be synchronized! (keep using the same binding to the variable "watchedList" for both fields).

level 7: The multiselectors are nice, but it would be great to also have a checkbox on each film card to mark it as watched/not watched. Of course, it should be synchronized with the "watchedList" array!

bonus level: Apply your CSS magic and designer's touch to make the app look great!
